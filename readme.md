# Node.js Demo App

This is the Node.js demo app for DevOps training.

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable production-ready code
- `dev`: Development and testing
- `feature/*`: New features or bugfix branches

## How to Contribute
1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Make changes, commit and push
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch into `dev`
4. After review, merge PR
5. Once stable, open a PR from `dev` into `main`
